# Goals

Apart from the major phases of the projects.
This particular project has been further divided into smaller milestones!

## Phase-I:

- [x] Scraper for Medium
- [x] Build a basic bot to get you articles based on a particular search criteria
- [ ] Return more details in the form of an object and also add more interactivity (Like what the  bot can do)
- [ ] Design a message block with the BlockKit Builder of Slack
- [ ] Apply the Block
- [ ] Allow channels to Subscribe to a particular tag and make the bot post the articles on that tag regularly
